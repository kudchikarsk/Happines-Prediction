<h4 class="mt-5">Unseen Restaurant Reviews To Try</h4>
    <div class="card mt-4">
      <div class="card-header"><h4 class="text-muted">Happy</h4></div>
            <pre>"What a pleasant place to stay!
      The hotel is beautiful, very modern, stylish, with attention to detail. Our room on the -th floor was spacious, with great decor, hardwood floors, Keurig coffee maker, and floor to ceiling windows.
      The bathroom was also big with a large shower. There was no tub, which was fine with us.
      One of the best things - a QUIET air-conditioner! Finally something that didn't wake me up at night. Overall, the room was very quite despite the fact that there were occupied rooms all around us.
      The staff was very pleasant. We asked if we could have a late check out at - pm. The gentleman at the desk graciously offered us - pm checkout due to our platinum status. It was perfect!
      The restaurant downstairs in the lobby was nice, but doesn't really have much selection for lunch. The upstairs patio bar on the -th floor was closed for renovation.
      The location is great. Within walking distance to Balboa Park (you can grab a free trolley once in the park), Seaport Village and of course Gaslamp. 
      There is really nothing bad I can say about this hotel. Our stay was truly a pleasure. If there's anything I can suggest is that they should add refrigerators and microwaves to rooms.
      Would love to come back."</pre>

            <pre>"I booked out the same day I arrived. It cost me $---. No fridge or cofeemaker in room. Beverages in the reception must be paid for. Hotel all no smoking. When my partner asked if there was a rear outside smoking area the desk clerk screamed """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Outside Outside"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and pointed to the front door. Problem is, there is a male strip club almost next door."</pre>

            <pre>"This hotel is a keeper! First, you get a full breakfast buffet every morning. Second, Friday and Saturday night is a great seafood buffet with crab legs. Third, it has a Comedy Zone franchise in the hotel.
Location right off I---- with plenty of places to eat near by."</pre>

      <div class="card-header"><h4 class="text-muted">Hard to Tell</h4></div>
            <pre>"I stayed here with my girlfriend who was attending a conference here. Picked the hotel based on that. 
The hotel is located well, not far from lots of shopping on Union Square and across the street from a main transit station. 
One thing I have to say is try to book on a higher floor. We where on Geary street on a lower floor and it was quite noisy most nights. If you wear earplugs it might suffice. 
Service was quick to the room."</pre>
